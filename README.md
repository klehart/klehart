# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm klehart â€“ an IT student from Germany.

I like to try out all kinds of coding stuff â€“  
from small hardware projects to APIs and web tools.  
If they turn out good enough, you'll probably find them here.

Arduino and ESP32 projects are my favorite,  
especially when it comes to messing around with WS2812B LED strips.
